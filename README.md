# Given Scenario
I recently got hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. I am asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. I will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this course and create supporting documents for the open source project including a code of conduct, and contribution guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.
